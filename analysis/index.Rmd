Most of the material for this github workshop comes from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and [John Blischak's paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668).


The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the terminal and git (and maybe even [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)).


* Lesson 1: ["Wait, what is a terminal?"](terminal_intro.html)  
  
  

* Lesson 2: ["I know what the terminal is, but what is git?"](git_intro.html)
    * [Why Should I use git?](git_2.html)   
    * [Setting up git with Github](git_1.html)   
    * [Starting with git](git_3.html)   
    * [Tracking history](git_4.html)
    * [Ignoring files](git_5.html)
