Most of the material for this github workshop comes from Software Carpentry and John Blischak's paper.


The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the terminal and git.


###Lesson 1: ["Wait, what is a terminal?"](terminal_intro.html)  
  
  

###Lesson 2: ["I know what the terminal is, but what is git?"](beginner.html)
