##Create a local git repository

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.
Let's create a directory for our work and then move into that directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir planets
```
Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository] ;a place where Git can store versions of our files:

```{bash}
git init
```

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```{bash}
ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

```{bash}
ls -a
```


Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```{bash}
git status
```

* * * * * * *
##Tracking changes

###Initial commit
Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
(We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier.)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano mars.txt
```

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:  

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color" > mars.txt
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
cat mars.txt
```


`mars.txt` now contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```{bash}
ls
```

```{bash}
cat mars.txt
```

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```{bash}
git status
```

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```{bash}
git add mars.txt
```
and then check that the right thing happened:

```{bash}
git status
```
Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

```{bash }
git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
```

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit]
(or [revision]) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`
(Your commit may have another identifier.)

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit.  If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.

If we run `git status` now:

```{bash}
git status
```

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:


```{bash}
git log
```


`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

* * * * * * *

###Editing files
Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman" >> mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:


```{bash}
git status
```

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

```{bash}
git diff
```

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` markers in the first column show where we have added lines.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```{bash}
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
git status
```

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

```{bash}
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything
because we may not want to commit everything at once.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
but *not* commit the work we're doing on the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [change set]
but not yet committed.  

  
* * * * * * *
##Recap
To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`)

##Try on your own!
Try adding this line to the file and staging and committing it on your own:  
`But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity`
