##What not to track

You can version control any file that you put in a Git repository, whether it is text-based, an image, or a giant data file. However, just because you can version control something, does not mean you should. Git works best for plain, text-based documents such as your scripts or your manuscript if written in LaTeX or Markdown. This is because for text files, Git saves the entire file only the first time you commit it and then saves just your changes with each commit. This takes up very little space, and Git has the capability to compare between versions (using git diff).  A good rule of thumb is to version control anything text-based: your scripts or manuscripts if they are written in plain text. Things not to version control are large data files that never change, binary files (including Word and Excel documents), and the output of your code.   

In addition to the type of file, you need to consider the content of the file. If you plan on sharing your commits publicly using GitHub, ensure you are not committing any files that contain sensitive information, such as human subject data or passwords.

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis. Let's create a few dummy files:

```{bash }
mkdir results
touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
```
and see what Git says:

```{bash}
git status
```

##gitignore file

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano .gitignore
cat .gitignore
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "*.dat" >.gitignore
echo "results/" >>.gitignore
cat .gitignore
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

```{bash}
git status
```

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

```{bash}
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add the ignore file"
git status
```

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding files to the
repository that we don't want to track:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add a.dat
```

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

```{bash}
git status --ignored
```
