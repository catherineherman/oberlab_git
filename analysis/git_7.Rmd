As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone else's toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy. Version control helps us manage these conflicts by giving us tools to resolve overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file mars.txt currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our planets repository:

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity" >mars.txt

```

```{bash}
cat mars.txt
```

Let's add a line to your file:

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to Wolfman's copy" >mars.txt

```

```{bash}
cat mars.txt
```

and then push the change to GitHub:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Adding a line in our home copy"
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "[master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)"
```


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git push origin master
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
   29aba7c..dabb4c8  master -> master"
```


Go into the repository on Github and change the file to add the following line and commit the change :
```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the other copy"
```

Now, back to the terminal locally, we can commit the change locally:  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Adding a line in my copy"
```


```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in my copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)"
```

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git push origin master
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git'

```


Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
*merge* them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git pull origin master
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "remote: Counting objects: 5, done.        
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.        
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)        
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."

```


`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cat mars.txt
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
=======
This line added to Wolfman's copy
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d"

```

Our change&mdash;the one in `HEAD`&mdash;is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cat mars.txt
```

```{bash}
echo "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line"
```


To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add mars.txt
git status
```


```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#   (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#"
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub"
```

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git push origin master
```


```{bash, echo=FALSE}
echo "Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 697 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  master -> master"

```

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again.
